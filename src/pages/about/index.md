A simple thought of creating a community, that would give a platform to us and everyone, who wants their story to be heard without being judged. We are a group of students following Sandeep Sir and his teachings. Sandeep sir is an inspiration and mentor to us and many. Discussing life stories and experiences together on a platform where anyone can learn and share with each other. We aim to create a healthy community for everyone, where topics are not just bound to motivation only, it could be any life experience that one has gone through.
As it is said:-
“When you create a difference in someone’s life, you not only impact their life, you impact everyone influenced by them throughout their entire lifetime.
No act is never too small.
One by one, this is how to make an ocean rise.”
