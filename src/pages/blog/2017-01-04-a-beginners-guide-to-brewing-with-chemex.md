Recently someone suggested me this book 'Asura'. I have always liked reading mythology and explore my religion, and this book took me further in my quest. So basically this book is Ramayan from Ravan's point of view. The core concept of the book thrilled me and reading it changed the way I saw Ravan. We are always told that he was a bad person, and in some ways he was, but there's more to his story. The struggle of his childhood, the misery, the pain and the victory makes him what he was. The book taught me to look on the other side of the coin, to see beyond what people have told to is the boundary. It's amongst the best books I have read so far and I strongly suggest this book to everyone . Yes, Ravan did a very fatel mistake by kidnapping Sita, not because she was Ram's wife but because she was a woman and her choices are to be respected. I personally like reading books that are attributed to the villains because they have a lot more life lessons then that is the hero's. This book taught me that you can conquer the world with knowledge but can loose everything if you can't resist the temptations of ego and superiority.

Asura a book everyone should read.
